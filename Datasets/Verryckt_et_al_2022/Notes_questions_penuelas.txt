What are the leaf clip and spectrometer?

Can they check that the link I made between Verryckt data and their is correct?
 - No middle branch data

Are they ok with the spectra processing I did?

Can they Check the folder names, description? Acknoledgments within.

I did a full QaQc of the ACi data and ended up removing a lot of data to ony keep very good quality data. Is it ok for them?


Reflectance data only in 2015?

I had to make a choice to define shaded and sunlit leaves. I decided that leaves only the top leaves of trees with a crown illumination index above 3 (i.e 4 and 5) where sunlit.
 
Do they know the phenological stage of the leaves? Can we consider that they measured only mature leaves?
