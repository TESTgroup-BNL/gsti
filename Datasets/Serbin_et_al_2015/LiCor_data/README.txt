Incomplete - need to place all of the compiled licor data here

Ag sites - ready
Non ag sites - for needleleaf samples, only some of the leaves have had an area correction completed.  Start with broadleaf samples and needle-leaf samples with area corrections

Next Steps:

Develop LiCor fitting code on raw gasex data using GasExchange package

Merge fitted data with spectral dataset availible on Ecosis.org https://ecosis.org/package/uw-bnl-nasa-hyspiri-airborne-campaign-leaf-and-canopy-spectra-and-trait-data
