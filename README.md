# Global_Vcmax

The aim of this project is to generate a global PLSR model that would allow to predict Vcmax25 robustly for any leaf associated with a natural plant.
To do so, we curate and combine all published ACi datasets that are linked to full range reflectancce data. The A-Ci data are fitted using the same procedure and the same model to avoid including biases between datasets that were fitted using multiple methods.

An overview of the process to curate the datasets is given in the pdf: [Curation workflow](https://github.com/TESTgroup-BNL/Global_Vcmax/blob/main/Overal_data_curation.pdf). The curation is divided in 4 steps (0 to 3) to import, analyse and produce and dataset with a determined format. Since all datasets are different, the code can be adapted for any of the steps but the format have to be similar so all the datasets can be, in the end, combined.
